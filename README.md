*WiFi Cracking Camp*

GUI tool for wireless WEP and WPA/WPA2 pentesting.
<br/><br/>
Developed by Pablo Sanz Alguacil, Miguel Yanes Fernández and Adam Chalkley, as the Group Project for 3rd year of the 
Bachelor of Science in Computing in Digital Forensics and Cyber Security at the **Technological University Dublin**.
<br/><br/><br/>
**Tool under development. Some features may not have been added yet.**

**Correct operation is not guaranteed.**
<br/><br/><br/>
Wireless pentesting tool with functionalities such as password cracking (in WEP and WPA/WPA2 networks), DoS attacks, 
client de-authentication, data decryption or fake base stations.
<br/><br/>

# Project insight

Tool developed in Python 3.7, developed and tested under Debian distributions (Ubuntu has also been tested). 
This tool is a frontend toolkit that integrates different open source tools for wireless pentesting. 
The utilised tools are the following:

* Aircrack-ng suite (including airdecap)
* ifconfig
* genpmk
* pyrit
* coWPAtty
* pgrep
* macchanger
<br/><br/>

# Requirements

You will need to run the program with root privileges, and using some version of Python 3+. Also, you need to have installed all of the tools mentioned in the section *Project insight*. Of course, as this is a wireless pentesting tool, you will need some wireless card to perform the scans/attacks. In case you miss some of these requirements, you won't be able to initiate the tool. 

Also, although it's not strictly necessary, it is highly recommended to use a wireless card that supports both monitor mode and packet injection. 
In case your wireless card doesn't support them, you will be able to execute the attacks but may miss some advanced 
functionalities to, for example, speed-up the network cracking process.
<br/><br/>

# Usage

The tool is a framework utility, but you need to run it from the command line. To do so, you need to run with root privileges and
with Python 3+:

> `$ sudo python3 WiCC.py [option(s)]`

<br/><br/>
There are also some advanced options that you can choose from the command line. These options are originaly meant for debugging
purposes, but you may find some of them useful:
* `-a` Auto-select the first available network interface.
* `-s` Avoid showing the splash image during startup.
* `-i` Ignore local save files.
* `-v` Select the verbose level for the output (default: 0, no output)

     * `-v`   Level 1 (basic output)
       
     * `-vv`  Level 2 (advanced output)
       
     * `-vvv` Level 3 (advanced output and executed commands)

You can always view the help with the option `--help`
<br/><br/>

# Final release
The actual release is a development version. You can expect a final release of the project for the first fortnight of May. Once the final version is released, we will keep working in the project to fix possible upcoming bugs, or even add new interesintg features. 
If you want to get in contact with us to notify us about some bug you encountered, or about some feature you want us to add, you can use the contact information showed on our GitHub profiles, listed below.
